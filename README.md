# Basic_Calculator
This basic calculator implements all the basic operations (addition,subtraction,multiplication,division,percentage) between two numbers.

Both integer and non-integer numbers can be given as input (using the point operator button for non-integers).

Operations are carried out linearly according to the input inserted. So, there are no special priorities between operations.

Screen values are not saved when the application is killed. This remains to be done.
